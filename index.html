        Subject: Leave Application for Medical Reason
        
        Dear Recipientâ€™s Name,
        
        I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from my classes due to a medical condition. I have been diagnosed with a specific illness or condition, as confirmed by my attending physician. Consequently, I need to take a break from my college duties to focus on my health and recovery.
        
        The duration of my proposed leave is from Start Date to End Date. During this period, I will be undergoing treatment and following the necessary medical advice to ensure a quick and full recovery. Attached with this application is my medical certificate, providing further details of my condition and the recommended rest period.
        
        I understand the importance of academic commitments, and thus, I have informed my course instructors about my situation. I will take all the necessary steps to catch up on any missed coursework or assignments upon my return.
        
        I kindly request your understanding and approval of my leave application. Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated, and I am hopeful for a positive response.
        
        Thank you for your attention to this matter.
        
        Sincerely,
        Your Name,
        Your Course/Department,
        Your Student ID.
    </pre>
